# Landing Page

This is my first attempt at a landing page for a fictional company. There are dropdown menu's and it is fully responsive.

## Front-end Mentor

This exercise was a challenge on frontendmentor.io which shows the design template in different screen sizes, active states etc.
It also includes the .json data and image files, but apart from that I had to figure out how to make it work myself.
This project is made using HTML and CSS only.
